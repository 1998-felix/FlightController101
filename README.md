# FlightController101
A project attempted at making a flight controller from scratch(hopefully)

We are intending to make the flight controller using an ESP32 board, speifically the EsP32Cam.

We are using micropython to simplify the development process and focus on the algorithim implementations.

Any contributions are welcome.
